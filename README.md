# Welcome to the Shared Build component #
The Shared Build component has three modules:

* **shared-build-parent**: a POM (Project Object Model) artifact that holds the configuration for the build plugins and the code quality profile
* **quality-tools-config**: a JAR (Java ARchive) that holds the resources (xml configuration) for the code quality profile in the parent
* **shared-dependencies**: a POM that holds the declarations for the major shared dependencies for the [SmarterApp](http://smarterapp.org) development effort
